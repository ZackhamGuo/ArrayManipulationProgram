# ArrayManipulationProgram
 An assembly program to manipulate some array

### What does it do
This programs can receive some number from std input to fill an array. Then it can push the array into stack, reverse it, or pop an array from stack. The purpose of doing this is to enhance the understanding of stack operations: `push`,`pop`; what is pushed into stack for implementing function call, what need to do to clear the stack after function call. As a low level language program of assembly, there is no compiler help you to do so, and all these have to be done by hand.

A simple interactive UI is included, and the program can run and interact will the user to achive its functionality.

Assemble with `MASM`.
